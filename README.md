My career goal is to become an innovative engineer and a Latino leader, inspired by my father's example. Ultimately, I am dedicated to breaking barriers, inspiring others, and contributing to the advancement of Hispanic/Latino students in higher education and making a lasting impact in my field. I pride myself on taking ownership of my work, challenging the norms to seek new transformative ideas, and incorporating past learnings into future outlooks. My three main core values are innovation, growth, and service.
